Hi, guys. Today, I will guide you on how to add a proxy to change your IP using the Proxy

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,630
Helper extension. First, go to the Chrome Web Store and install the Proxy Helper extension.

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,700
After installing, click on this icon and pin the extension.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,580
Right-click and select Options to open Proxy Helper. This is the interface of the tool,

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,300
it looks very simple, right? I'll introduce the features of Proxy Helper one by one.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,480
In the General section, Proxy Helper supports proxies for four protocols, HTTP,

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,720
HTTPS, SOC S, and QUIC. Use the protocol that fits your proxy and fill in the

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,060
information in the corresponding section. If you're not sure which type your proxy is,

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,210
just fill in all four sections. Next is the Proxy Mode. There are five different types,

10
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,590
Single Proxy, Proxy for HTTPS, Proxy for HTTP, Proxy for FTP, and Fallback Proxy.

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,210
You can just select the default option, which is Single Proxy.

12
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,750
If your proxy has a username and password, go to the authentication

13
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:28,570
section to enter that information. You only need to set these two sections,

14
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,610
and you're done. Now, let's go to IP Fighter to check the new IP address.

15
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:42,710
Just select HTTP Proxy. After selecting the correct proxy protocol, refresh the IP Fighter page.

16
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,250
The IP address and location have changed. So, you've successfully added the proxy.

17
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,730
If this proxy can't access the internet, try the other protocols to see which one works.

18
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,950
There are also other options like Auto Detect, this automatically detects proxy

19
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,670
settings from the system or network. For example, if you're using a VPN or have

20
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,490
set up a proxy on your computer, it will automatically catch the IP based on those settings.

21
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,490
System, this uses the system's proxy settings.

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,610
Direct, this accesses the website without using a proxy.

23
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,610
You can add the extension to different Chrome profiles to change the IP for each one.

24
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,600
For example, I added Proxy Helper on another Chrome profile with a US Proxy.

25
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,280
Just follow the steps I just showed you to add and access it.

26
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,830
Now, the two profiles have different IP addresses and locations.

27
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,690
Additionally, Proxy Helper has a Bypass List feature in the Rules section, which allows

28
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,910
users to set certain websites to access without using a proxy, instead using the original IP.

29
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,930
For instance, instead of using IPv4, you can use IPv6 to manage your Facebook accounts more

30
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,850
efficiently. However, some of Facebook's payment services aren't fully compatible with IPv6 yet.

31
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,430
So when you add a payment card while creating an ad campaign, you might run into errors.

32
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,730
In this case, by adding websites to the list, when you need to link a bank card,

33
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,050
the system will use your original IP without going through the proxy, helping you bypass

34
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,390
the website quickly without switching back to IPv4. That's how to use Proxy Helper to change

35
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,690
proxies and fake your IP on the Chrome browser. You can use this extension on Edge profiles or

36
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,590
use Foxy Proxy for Firefox. Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you all the best.
