00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Hi guys, welcome back to our channel IP Fighter.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,720
Cloudflare acts as a strong shield against unwanted bots and cyber threats.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,660
But what if you need to access data or automate tasks?

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,660
In this video, we'll reveal the tactics for bypassing Cloudflare's security.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,120
Before we dive into bypassing Cloudflare, let's learn a bit about what Cloudflare does.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,780
Cloudflare Bot Protection, provided by a well-known web security company,

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,560
is part of Cloudflare's Security Operations Center.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,320
It offers services like comprehensive security monitoring, incident response, and threat

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,560
detection. The bot management module is designed to handle various types of bots that can get

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,160
through captures and cause issues like credit card stuffing, credential stuffing, and more.

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,240
While it blocks certain types of bots, it allows others like Google's bots, chatbots,

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,020
personal assistant bots, and web crawling bots.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,760
However, for professionals and businesses relying on large-scale web scraping,

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,200
Cloudflare's bot management can be a challenge.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,680
Web pages protected by Cloudflare often block bot access.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,200
If you've faced issues like Error 1012, Denied Access, or Error 1015, you're being

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,380
rate-limited, you'll need to understand how Cloudflare identifies bots to bypass its

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,960
security. Cloudflare employs two main approaches to detect and deal with bots, passive and

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,000
active bot detection. Let's take a closer look at these techniques.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,500
The first one is passive bot detection. Passive bot detection methods observe automated

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,840
bots without interfering with them. Cloudflare uses these techniques to spot bots.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,120
Cloudflare tracks bot networks' behavior and flags IP addresses and devices displaying

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,340
harmful bot-like activities. If a request comes from one of these flagged IP addresses,

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,860
Cloudflare blocks it. Every IP address has a fraud or risk score,

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,580
indicating its reputation based on factors like the ISP, location, and source.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,420
Cloudflare also analyzes HTTP request headers to distinguish bots from real users.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,980
Requests not coming from typical web browsers or lacking necessary headers are flagged as

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,640
bots and blocked. TSL fingerprinting technique helps Cloudflare detect the user agent by

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,940
examining TLS client hello messages and the user agent header. If these match known

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,040
fingerprints, the request is allowed. Just like TLS, Cloudflare uses HTTP slash

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,820
two headers to identify bots. This technology creates unique fingerprints for each request,

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,860
helping Cloudflare verify them. The second approach is active bot protection.

33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,300
Active bot detection involves checking on the visitor's site to identify and block bots.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,500
Cloudflare uses various methods for this. Captures challenge bots since they require

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,200
human intelligence to solve. Cloudflare uses captures to detect bots in some cases.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Additionally, Cloudflare observes actions like keyboard typing and mouse clicks to

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,420
determine if a request is from a human or bot. Canvas fingerprinting records specific

38
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,540
details about a user's web browser, creating a unique fingerprint. It helps

39
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,620
distinguish between legitimate users and bots. Another fingerprinting method,

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,440
browser fingerprinting, identifies a device by analyzing attributes like screen size,

41
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,060
browser type, and installed plugins. Cloudflare uses this to create a device fingerprint,

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,420
which helps spot bots. Cloudflare also gathers data about the user's environment,

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,840
such as the operating system and screen resolution. This helps Cloudflare identify

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,540
bot behavior patterns. To bypass Cloudflare's security, you'll need to focus on two key

45
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,760
your IP address and browser fingerprint. Here's how you can do it. Firstly, you can avoid

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,880
triggering suspicion by sending too many requests from a single IP address.

47
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,140
To change your IP address, consider using a VPN or proxy. Residential proxies work well

48
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,640
to avoid raising suspicions. Additionally, you can modify your browser fingerprint with

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,240
HIDE-MIAC Anti-Detect Browser. You can use an anti-detect browser such as HIDE-MIAC to

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,920
create profiles with different browser fingerprints, which helps you bypass

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,060
Cloudflare's bot detection. You can also customize your browser fingerprint parameters

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,400
like user agent, operating system, screen resolution, and more. Moreover,

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,320
for automating tasks without triggering Cloudflare's bot detection, HIDE-MIAC offers an

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,580
automation feature. It allows you to create scripts that simulate human actions while using

55
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:40,380
multiple profiles. You can download HIDE-MIAC and start your 7-day free trial via the link

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,040
in the description. That's the guide to conquer Cloudflare's defenses and enhance
