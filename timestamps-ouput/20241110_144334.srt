Hi, guys. Today, I will guide you on how to add a proxy to change your IP using the Proxy

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,640
Helper extension. First, go to the Chrome Web Store and install the Proxy Helper extension.

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,720
After installing, click on this icon and pin the extension.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,580
Right-click and select Options to open Proxy Helper. This is the interface of the tool,

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,340
it looks very simple, right? I'll introduce the features of Proxy Helper one by one.

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,480
In the General section, Proxy Helper supports proxies for four protocols, HTTP,

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,400
HTTPS, SOC S, and QUIC. Use the protocol that fits your proxy and fill in the information in

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,020
the corresponding section. If you're not sure which type your proxy is, just fill in all

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:04,160
four sections. Next is the Proxy mode. There are five different types, Single Proxy,

10
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,820
Proxy for HTTPS, Proxy for HTTP, Proxy for FTP, and Fallback Proxy. You can just select

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,380
the default option, which is Single Proxy. If your proxy has a username and password,

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:27,900
go to the Authentication section to enter that information. You only need to set these

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,640
sections, and you're done. Now, let's go to IP Fighter to check the new IP address.

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,100
Just select HTTP Proxy. After selecting the correct proxy protocol, refresh the IP Fighter

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:50,240
page. The IP address and location have changed. So, you've successfully added the proxy.

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,720
If this proxy can't access the internet, try the other protocols to see which one works.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,580
There are also other options like Auto Detect, this automatically detects proxy settings from

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,840
the system or network. For example, if you're using a VPN or have set up a proxy on your

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,740
computer, it will automatically catch the IP based on those settings. System, this uses

20
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,640
the system's proxy settings. Direct, this accesses the website without using a proxy.

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,500
You can add the extension to different Chrome profiles to change the IP for each one.

22
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,640
For example, I added Proxy Helper on another Chrome profile with a US Proxy.

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,260
Just follow the steps I just showed you to add and access it.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,900
Now, the two profiles have different IP addresses and locations.

25
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,700
Additionally, Proxy Helper has a Bypass List feature in the Rules section, which allows

26
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,960
users to set certain websites to access without using a proxy, instead using the original IP.

27
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,640
For instance, instead of using IPv4, you can use IPv6 to manage your Facebook accounts

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,700
more efficiently. However, some of Facebook's payment services aren't fully compatible with

29
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,800
IPv6 yet. So when you add a payment card while creating an ad campaign, you might run

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,740
In this case, by adding websites to the list, when you need to link a bank card,

31
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,080
the system will use your original IP without going through the proxy, helping you bypass

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,400
the website quickly without switching back to IPv4. That's how to use Proxy Helper to change

33
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,000
proxies and fake your IP on the Chrome browser. You can use this extension on Edge

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,600
profiles or use Foxy Proxy for Firefox. Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you all the best.
